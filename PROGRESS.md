  - [ ] Root CLAUDE.md slimmed
  - [ ] GitHub side (PR template, CI, branch protection, CodeRabbit, Gemini)
  - [ ] Pre-PR ritual script
- [ ] **Live↔BT parity** (plan: `docs/live-bt-parity-plan.md`)
  - [x] Forensic reconciliation report
  - [x] MT5 deal history timezone fix

## Next

- [ ] **Optuna optimiser** (replaces random sweep for serious runs)
- [ ] **Walk-forward validation** (in-sample / out-of-sample rolling windows)
- [ ] **Monte Carlo robustness** (stressed seeds, confidence bands on metrics)
- [ ] **Experiment tracker** (history of sweeps, not just latest)

## Shipped
